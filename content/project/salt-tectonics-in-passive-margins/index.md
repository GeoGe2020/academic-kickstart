title: Salt tectonics in passive margins
subtitle: an analogue modelling approach
date: 2020-07-01T01:09:35.063Z
summary: Passive margin salt basins typically have a kinematic domain partition
  of an upslope extension, a mid-slope translation and a downslope contraction
  as the supra-salt cover strata deform under its own weight (e.g. Rowan et al.,
  2004; Brun & Fort, 2011). Despite the general acceptance of such conceptual
  models, many unsolved problems and controversies still exist and being
  debated. For example, the role of gravity-spreading in passive margins, the
  interaction between salt tectonics and associated sedimentary systems. This
  project utilizes state-of-the-art analogue modelling technique (wtih GFZ) to
  develop some new ideas to help us better under salt-related deformation in
  passive margins as well as other settings.
