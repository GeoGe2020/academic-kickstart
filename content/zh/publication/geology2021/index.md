abstract: Tectonically controlled topography influences deep-water sedimentary systems. Using 3-D seismic reflection data from the Levant Basin, eastern Mediterranean Sea, we investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of bedforms on a deep-water fan cut by an active normal fault. In the footwall, the fan comprises cyclic steps and antidunes along its axial and external portions, respectively, which we interpret to result from the spatial variation in flow velocity due to the loss of confinement at the canyon mouth. Conversely, in the hanging wall, the seafloor is nearly featureless at seismic scale. Numerical modeling of turbidity currents shows that the fault triggers a hydraulic jump that suppresses the flow velocity downstream, which thus explains the lack of visible bedforms basinward. This study shows that the topography generated by active normal faulting controls the downslope evolution of turbidity currents and the associated bedforms and that seafloor geomorphology can be used to evince syn-tectonic deposition.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
