I am an assistant professor at College of Geosciences, China University of Petroleum (Beijing). My research mainly focuses on the tectono-stratigraphic evolution of sedimentary basins, particularly where the salt-controlled structures and deep-water sedimentation interact. I have worked closely with industry in multiple research projects in the last couple of years. Currently I am involved in a research project between University of Bergen and German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) focusing on salt tectonics in passive margins. I have published over 10 peer-reviewed articles in international geoscience journals.
