abstract: Salt structures in linked extensional–contractional systems of passive margin sedimentary basins and deepwater fold belts play an important role in the evolution of rifted continental margins. The 100 km wide Jequitinhonha Basin with its salt-detached deepwater fold belt provides insight in the post-rift salt deformation processes in deepwater fold belts of the central Brazilian continental margin.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We use seismic data to study the structural style and kinematic evolution of the Jequitinhonha Basin, Brazil.
