Zhiyuan Ge is an assistant professor at College of Geosciences, China University of Petroleum (Beijing). Dr. Ge graduated with B.S. in Geology from Zhejiang University. He obtained M.S. from Royal Holloway, University of London, where he developed his interests in salt tectonics. He completed his thesis work with Dr. Rob Gawthorpe (main), Dr. Atle Rotevatn, Dr. Wojciech Nemec and Dr. Michel BÃ¸gh Thomas in the Earth Science Department at University of Bergen in 2015. He then spent next four years as a postdoc in the same rsearch group. His research mainly focuses on the tectono-stratigraphic evolution of sedimentary basins, particularly where the salt-controlled structures and deep-water sedimentation interact. He has worked closely with industry in multiple research projects in the last couple of years. Currently He is obsessed with driven forces of salt tectonics and the associated structural and kinematic evolution in salt-bearing passive margins. He has published over 10 peer-reviewed articles in international geoscience journals.
